/**
 * This class represents a text box for numeric values.

 * Your task is to add JML contracts for each method in this class
 * that reflect the informal descriptions in the Javadoc comments.
 * Also add JML invariants for the fields "cursorPosition" and "content" that make sure that
 * - the cursorPosition is always a valid value (see comment for cursorPosition).
 * - the content before the cursor contains only single digits
 * - the content after the cursor is EMPTY
 * Furthermore, think about which methods are pure and use the appropriate annotation.
 * Do NOT implement the methods!
 * 
 * Hint: If you use variables for array indices in an assignable-clause,
 * 		 their values are evaluated in the pre-state.
