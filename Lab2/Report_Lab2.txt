Software Enginering Using Formal Methods Lab 2
Anton Bergman & Emil Kristiansson
============================================

1
We start by breaking up the right side of the expression, and move everything to the left side using the notRight rule.
This gives us a lot of implications on the left side which we can use impLeft to close.
We are a bit unefficient, as sometimes the same rules are applied in both cases at a branch. We would create fewer total steps if these rules
were applied before splitting the proof into different cases.

3.1
We inline the method on unimportant things such as printing, and use the method contract otherwise.
